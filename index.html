        I donâ€™t know where to start, but this day always makes me feel something deep.  
        Itâ€™s your birthday, and I wanted to do something simpleâ€¦ yet heartfelt.  
        I made this space for you, hoping it brings a smile, even if Iâ€™m just another person in the crowd of your well-wishers.  
        <br/><br/>
        I remember the way your smile randomly crosses my mind, how little things remind me of you.  
        You may not know this, and maybe youâ€™ll never feel the same â€“ and thatâ€™s okay.  
        I never made this to make you love me back.  
        I made this because I do love you in a quiet, respectful way â€“ the kind of love that expects nothing.  
        <br/><br/>
        Today, I just want to say: you deserve happiness, pure and big.  
        I hope life gives you everything you dream of.  
        And even if I stay a memory or a silent corner in your life, Iâ€™ll still celebrate this dayâ€¦ every year.  
        <br/><br/>
        Happy birthday, Anchita.  
        Youâ€™re truly special.  
        â€“ Yours, quietly.
